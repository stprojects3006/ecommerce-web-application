## Overview & Testing Objectives

This guide details how to monitor and analyze the Queue-It integration using Grafana dashboards, aligned with the testing objectives from the functional testing project:
- **Functional Validation**: Ensure Queue-It works as intended
- **Performance Testing**: Monitor system under load
- **Integration Testing**: Validate end-to-end flows
- **Error Handling**: Detect and analyze failures
- **Monitoring**: Real-time health and performance

## Monitoring Activities & Metrics by Testing Objective

### 1. Functional Validation
- **Service Health**: Uptime, downtime, restarts
- **Queue Status**: Active queue size, users served
- **Primary Panels**: Service Health (Up/Down), Flash Sale Users Served

### 2. Performance Testing
- **Request Latency**: 95th percentile, max latency
- **Throughput**: Request rate, users served/min
- **Queue Wait Time**: Average, SLA compliance
- **Primary Panels**: API Gateway 95th Percentile Latency, Flash Sale Avg Wait Time, API Gateway Max Latency (1h)

### 3. Integration Testing
- **End-to-End Flow**: Queue entry, token validation, users served
- **Panel Examples**: API Gateway Token Failures, Checkout Time to First Served

### 4. Error Handling
- **Error Rates**: API errors, frontend overlay/token errors, abandonment
- **Panel Examples**: API Gateway Error Rate, Frontend Overlay Errors, Black Friday Abandonment Rate

### 5. Monitoring (Real-Time & Advanced)
- **Dashboards**: Comprehensive, API Performance, Frontend Metrics, Load Testing
- **Drilldown**: Use Loki/Promtail for log aggregation and root cause analysis
- **Alerting**: Set up Prometheus/Grafana alerts for high latency, error rates, downtime

## üõ†Ô∏è Detailed Steps: Dashboard & Panel Setup

### 1. Import a Dashboard
1. Open Grafana and log in (see Quick Access above).
2. Click the **+** icon in the left sidebar, then select **Import**.
3. Upload the relevant JSON file (markd as primary) from `config/grafana_dashboards/` (see [Consolidated Dashboard Reference Table](#consolidated-dashboard-reference-table)).
4. Select your Prometheus data source and click **Import**.

### 2. Add a New Panel
1. Open the imported dashboard.
2. Click **Add panel** (top right) or the **+** icon ‚Üí **Add new panel**.
3. In the Query section, select **Prometheus** as the data source.
4. Copy the PromQL query for your desired metric/panel from the [Consolidated Dashboard Reference Table](#consolidated-dashboard-reference-table) (see the "Steps/Expected Result/Impact" column for guidance).
5. Paste the query into the Query field.

### 3. Configure Panel Settings
1. Set the **Visualization Type** (e.g., Time series, Gauge, Bar chart) as recommended in the table.
2. Set the **Panel Name** (see "Name/Panel/Metric/KPI/Test" in the table).
3. Set the **X-Axis** and **Y-Axis** labels as per the table.
4. Set thresholds, units, and legend as needed (see "Value/Threshold/Default").
5. (Optional) Add alert rules or annotations as described in the table.

### 4. Save and View
1. Click **Apply** to add the panel to your dashboard.
2. Click **Save dashboard** (disk icon) to persist your changes.
3. Use the time picker and refresh controls to view real-time and historical data.

### 5. Cross-Reference for Details
- For queries, settings, and expected results for each panel/metric/configuration, see the [Consolidated Dashboard Reference Table](#consolidated-dashboard-reference-table) below.
- For troubleshooting, see the Troubleshooting rows in the same table.

**üéâ Your Queue-It testing reports are now available in Grafana!**

1. Open `http://localhost:3000`
2. Login: `admin` / `admin123`
3. Select a Queue-It dashboard
4. Run tests to see live metrics

## Advanced Monitoring: Drilldown, Logging, and Alerting

- **Log Aggregation**: Use Loki/Promtail for collecting and searching logs
- **Link Metrics to Logs**: Enable "Explore" or "Logs" links in panels for root cause analysis
- **Alerting**: Set up Prometheus/Grafana alerts for key metrics (latency, errors, downtime)
- **Example Workflow**:
  - See a spike in latency or downtime in a panel
  - Click to view logs for the relevant service and time window
  - Filter logs by service, error type, or message
  - Investigate and resolve issues quickly
